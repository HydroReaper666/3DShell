Purpose:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3DShell (pronounced 3D-Shell) - is a multi-purpose file manager for the Nintendo 3DS that aims towards handling media files. Unlike [FBI](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI) which specializes more in title management, 3DShell leans towards more of the file management features such as opening and managing various files types and includes the basic necessity of a standard file manager. This program's design elements are clearly inspired by CyanogenMod/LineageOS's built in file manager, and so all credits towards the design go to the CyanogenMod/LineageOS contributors.


Current features:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Storage bar (at the very top, just beneath the current working directory).
- Precise battery percentage using mcu::hwc.
- Creating new folders and files.

- Extract various archives such as ZIP, RAR, 7Z, ISO 9660, AR, XAR and others supported by libarchive.
- Searching for directories (allows you to quickly visit a directory by clicking the search icon on the top right (bottom screen).)
- File properties - lets you view info on current file/folder, such as size, modified time, parent folder etc.

Building from source:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ensure you have the devkitPro, ctrulib and citro3D and citro2D installed correctly. Make sure you have [makerom](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR) and [bannertool](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool) installed into your path as well.

2. Install the following dependecies from [devkitPro's pacman](https://devkitpro.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=8702):
* `sudo dkp-pacman -Syu 3ds-dev --noconfirm --needed`
* `sudo dkp-pacman -Syu 3ds-curl --noconfirm --force`
* `sudo dkp-pacman -Syu 3ds-libogg --noconfirm`
* `sudo dkp-pacman -Syu 3ds-libvorbisidec --noconfirm`
* `sudo dkp-pacman -Syu 3ds-mpg123 --noconfirm`
* `sudo dkp-pacman -Syu 3ds-opusfile --noconfirm`
* `sudo dkp-pacman -Syu 3ds-flac --noconfirm`
* `sudo dkp-pacman -Syu 3ds-libarchive --noconfirm`

3. Clone the 3DShell repository:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/joel16/3DShell.git
```
4. Open the project diretory:
```bash
cd 3DShell/
